## üöÄ Features

- *Code Execution in Docker*  
  - Each user‚Äôs code is executed inside an isolated Docker container.  
  - Input and output are handled via mounted volumes for secure interaction.  
  - Supports multiple programming languages (Python, C++, etc.).  

- *AI-Powered Code Review* (via *Google Gemini*)  
  - After execution, Gemini analyzes the user‚Äôs code.  
  - Provides constructive feedback, optimizations, and error explanations.  
  - Helps users understand and improve their code quality.  

- *Django Backend*  
  - Problem management, code submission, and results tracking.  
  - API endpoints for compiler integration.  

- *Nginx with SSL*  
  - Hosted on *AWS EC2*.  
  - SSL termination with Nginx for secure HTTPS access.

## üõ† Tech Stack

- *Backend*: Django (Python)  
- *Code Execution*: Docker (containers for compiler app)  
- *AI Review*: Google Gemini API  
- *Deployment*: AWS EC2 with Nginx (SSL)  
- *Database*: SQLite/PostgreSQL (depending on environment)

## ‚öô System Architecture

1. User writes and submits code.  
2. Django saves the submission and forwards it to the *compiler app*.  
3. The compiler app runs the submitted code inside a *Docker container* with mounted input/output volumes.  
4. Execution results are returned to Django.  
5. If execution is complete, Gemini is triggered to provide *AI feedback* on the code.  
6. Results and feedback are displayed to the user.

## üì¶ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Exec_0.git
cd mysite
```



### 2. Install Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Gemini API Key
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

### 4. Run Database Migrations
```
python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. Run the Django Development Server
```
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

## üê≥ Code Execution with Docker

The compiler app runs user code inside Docker:
```
docker run --rm
-v /path/to/code:/app/codes
-v /path/to/input:/app/inputs
-v /path/to/output:/app/outputs
code-runner bash -c "python3 /app/codes/main.py < /app/inputs/input.txt > /app/outputs/output.txt"
```

This ensures:  
- Isolation ‚Äì No direct access to host machine.  
- Security ‚Äì Prevents malicious code from escaping the container.  
- Reproducibility ‚Äì Same environment for all executions.  

---

## ü§ñ AI-Powered Code Review with Gemini

After successful execution:  
- The submitted code is passed to Google Gemini API.  
- Gemini analyzes the logic, detects inefficiencies, and suggests improvements.  
- Feedback is displayed alongside the execution results.  

Example feedback Gemini can provide:  
- Explaining runtime errors in simple terms.  
- Suggesting more efficient algorithms.  
- Warning about potential security issues.

## üåç Deployment on AWS EC2

The project is deployed on AWS EC2.  
Nginx is used as a reverse proxy and for SSL termination.  
Project files are directly cloned and run inside the EC2 instance.  

Deployment Steps:
Clone project inside EC2
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Exec_0.git
cd Exec_0
```

Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Collect static files
```
python manage.py collectstatic
```

Setup Nginx for reverse proxy + SSL
```
sudo yum install nginx
sudo systemctl status nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
sudo yum install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
sudo vim /etc/nginx/conf.d/domain.conf

server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    server_name your_domain; #replace you_domain with your actual domain
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000; #port your app is running on
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}

```

## üîí Security Considerations

- Code execution happens in isolated Docker containers.  
- No sensitive data is exposed to user code.  
- SSL ensures secure communication over HTTPS.
